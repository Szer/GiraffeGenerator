        This API is based on Solr/Lucense Search. The data is indexed using
        SOLR. This GET API returns the list of all the searchable field names
        that are in the Solr Index. Please see the 'fields' attribute which
        returns an array of field names. Each field or a combination of fields
        can be searched using the Solr/Lucene Syntax. Please refer
        https://lucene.apache.org/core/3_6_2/queryparsersyntax.html#Overview for
        the query syntax. List of field names that are searchable can be
        determined using above GET api.
